# SO101 Baseline Test (Pen + Cup)

We’ve extended the approach to the **LeRobot SO101 arm** using a new set of fine-tuned weights and real-world demonstrations. The eventual goal is to transfer sim-learned behavior to a more affordable, accessible robot platform.

- [Fine-Tuned Model](https://huggingface.co/karimnihal/smolvla_so101_pen_cup_base) — `smolvla_so101_pen_cup_base`
- [Training Dataset](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lerobot/visualize_dataset?path=%2Fkarimnihal%2Fso101-pen-cup%2Fepisode_0) — 1st-person RGB + action episodes

**Status:** Ongoing. Currently testing performance across episodes and exploring sim2real generalization strategies.
